/**
 * What a poke can be about, and the nine switches that decide which of them reach you.
 *
 * ## Account-wide, which is the whole point
 *
 * These are not per-organisation. Somebody who does not want to hear about merges does not want
 * to hear about them anywhere, and asking that question once per org would be asking it four
 * times for one answer. An organisation can still narrow further - that is what a subscription
 * is - but nothing can widen past what is set here.
 *
 * ## Why a flat list under headings rather than collapsible groups
 *
 * Because the window underneath is the point. Every row is a hover target that scrolls the reel
 * to the poke that row produces, so you can see what you are switching off before you switch it
 * off - and a group that folds away takes its rows, and that answer, with it. The headings are
 * dividers with a control on them, not sections that open.
 *
 * ## Why the switches move before the server answers
 *
 * Because a switch that waits for a round trip is a switch people press twice. The write is short
 * and nearly always succeeds; where it does not, the panel goes back to what was stored and says
 * so on the line under the list. See pokeSettingsLogic.
 *
 * ## The one row that is not a kind
 *
 * Under the review request sits a row about the same poke: whether it is crossed out at the
 * first review from anybody, or kept until GitHub stops asking you. It is drawn like the nine
 * around it, with a select where they have a tick, because what it asks has two answers rather
 * than yes or no. It is not counted in the header, because it is not a kind - it changes what
 * happens to a poke after it has arrived, not whether it arrives - and its card in the reel is
 * that poke a little later, struck through. It goes quiet when the request itself is off:
 * there is nothing to cross out.
