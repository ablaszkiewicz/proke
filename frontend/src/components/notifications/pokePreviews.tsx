/**
 * What a poke looks like where it lands: in Slack, from proke, as a direct message.

 * These mirror `buildPokeMessage` on the backend line for line - the same leads ("requested your
 * review on", "merged", "mentioned you on"), the same ✅/❌ markers on a submitted review, the
 * repository underneath. If that file's wording changes, this one is what has gone stale.
 *
 * Every card is deliberately the same shape and therefore the same height: the reel that stacks
 * them scrolls by whole rows and would drift if one of them were taller. That is also why the
 * message is one truncating line rather than a real Slack quote block.
