/**
 * Which kinds of poke reach this account at all, and the one way they change.
 *
 * Deliberately the same shape as inboxSettingsLogic, because it is the same problem: settings
 * that live on the account, arrive on the profile, and are moved one switch at a time.
 *
 * ## Where the settings come from
 *
 * The profile - `authLogic` reads it before anything under `/app` renders - so nothing here
 * loads anything and the panel's first frame is already the truth rather than nine switches
 * drawn on and corrected a moment later. What this logic holds is the edits made since.
 *
 * ## Why the writes are optimistic
 *
 * Because every setting is a switch, and a switch that waits for a round trip before moving is a
 * switch people press twice. The edit lands on screen at the press; the server's answer replaces
 * it a moment later, and on the rare failure the edit is dropped, the panel goes back to what
 * the server last agreed to, and a line says so.
 *
 * ## Why the whole set is sent
 *
 * Because unmuting is spelled by sending the set *without* that type in it - there is no other
 * way to say it - so a partial update could not express half of what this panel does. Two
 * presses in quick succession each send the set as it stood at that press, and the breakpoint
 * drops the earlier answer if a later save has started, so the last thing on screen is the last
 * thing saved.
