 * `import type`, and it has to stay that way. This file is reached from the global analytics

 * delivery already imports MetricsService, which imports this. Type-only, TypeScript erases it
 * and no `require` is emitted.
 *
 * Worth the care rather than redeclaring the union locally: the dimension *is* the delivery
 * outcome, and a second copy would drift from it silently - which shows up as a chart that
 * disagrees with the code about how many ways a poke can fail.

/**
 * Every metric the backend sends, and the dimensions each one carries.
 *
 * The sibling of analytics-events.ts, and deliberately shaped like it - a union rather than an
 * enum, so a name reads as itself at the call site and a typo is a compile error. Two things
 * differ, and both are forced by what metrics are:
 *
 *  - **No central prefix.** Events are all `backend_*` without exception, so AnalyticsService
 *    can apply that in one place. Here `http.server.duration` is an OpenTelemetry convention and
 *    has to stay unprefixed to chart against anything else that speaks OTel, so the full name is
 *    written out and the `proke.` prefix is a convention rather than a rule the code enforces.
 *
 *  - **The shape is part of the type.** A metric name means one of a counter, a gauge or a
 *    histogram, and recording the same name as two of them blends both into one chart. Splitting
 *    the union three ways makes that unrepresentable rather than a warning at runtime.
 *
 * ## The rule every attribute below obeys
 *
 * A series is `name + type + unit + every attribute value`, and the flush window holds a thousand
 * of them across the whole process before it starts dropping new ones - silently, past one
 * warning. So an attribute may only ever take values from a set that is closed and small: an
 * event name, a status code, a reason. Never a user id, a repository, an installation, a pull
 * request number. Those questions are answered by events, which carry identity properly, and by
 * the `distinctId` on them.
 *
 * Everything unbounded that reaches this file is therefore funnelled through the `*Label`
 * helpers at the bottom, which map anything unrecognised onto `other`. That is the difference
 * between a new GitHub event type costing one series and costing the whole budget.

/**
 * Why a poke that was going to be sent was not.
 *
 * The one metric that makes the whole routing funnel visible, because every one of these is
 * today a `continue`, a `logger.debug` or nothing at all.
 *
 * ## These are stage counts, not a partition - read them as a shape, not as a sum
 *
 * The unit changes halfway down the pipeline, and it has to. Above `groupByUser` a drop is one
 * *candidate*, and one person can be several: the author of a pull request who is also mentioned
 * in it arrives twice. At `groupByUser` those collapse to one recipient, which is the whole point
 * of grouping - one person gets one poke - and every reason below it therefore counts *people*.
 *
 * So `bot_chatter` and `not_subscribed` are not directly comparable, and the reasons do not add
 * up to the candidates that entered. The early ones run high relative to the late ones, because
 * most candidates were never going to be anybody. Comparing a reason against itself over time is
 * the question this answers well; reading the bars against each other as shares of one total is
 * the question it answers badly.
 *
 * There is deliberately no reason for "this event concerned nobody". That is not a dropped poke,
 * it is an event that never produced one, and mixing the two would make even the shape useless.
