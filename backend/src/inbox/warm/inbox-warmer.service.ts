 * pokes and never opens the inbox: gated on activity alone they would cost a GitHub query every
 * five minutes, for ever, for a page they do not look at.
 *
 * Forty-eight hours covers a working week and deliberately not a weekend - somebody who stops on

/**
 * Rebuilds everybody's inbox on a timer, under the settings they have stored.
 *
 * ## What it is and is not
 *
 * It calls `InboxRefreshService.refresh` and nothing else - the same code path the endpoint
 * takes, with a timer for a trigger instead of a request. Which is why that service was written
 * as the only thing in the module that talks to GitHub: there is no second implementation of an
 * inbox here to drift from the first.
 *
 * It does not make the client's own refresh unnecessary, and is not meant to. The page still
 * asks GitHub behind rows that are already on screen. What this buys is that the rows are
 * *there* for the first frame - after a deploy and after a night away, which are the two cases
 * where otherwise they are not.
 *
 * ## Why there is nothing to configure
 *
 * There used to be: a list of views per person, pinned by hand. That asked people to predict
 * which settings they would want ready, which is a question nobody has an answer to, and it
 * warmed nothing for the majority who never pressed the button. Now the thing warmed is the
 * thing the page will open on - the settings on the user row - and the only decision left is
 * whether somebody has been here lately, which is made by Mongo in the query.
 *
 * ## Why a plain timer, and why no leader election
 *
 * A timer because two services in this codebase already do exactly this and a dependency for one
 * `setInterval` is not worth its own line in the lockfile. `unref`, like both of them, or the
 * timer alone keeps the process - and every jest run - alive.
 *
 * No leader election because the thing being warmed is a cache inside this process. A second
 * replica warming its own is correct rather than duplicated work; there is nothing shared to
 * coordinate over - the sweep reads Mongo and never writes it. The cost is that GitHub calls
 * multiply by replica count, which is worth knowing before scaling out and is not a reason to
 * coordinate.
 *
 * ## What it is careful about
 *
 * A sweep that overruns its interval must not have another started on top of it, so there is a
 * re-entrancy guard and a counter that says when it fires. And nothing may throw out of the
 * timer callback: an unhandled rejection there takes the process down, and a warm cache is never
 * worth that.
