 * hour a user has - so the refresher this is built for can run every minute and spend about
 * one percent of one person's budget doing it.
 *
 * The budget is per user and not pooled: user-to-server requests bill the authenticated user,
 * shared with whatever else acts on their behalf, and never the organisation. Which is the whole
 * argument for asking as the user here rather than as the installation - that, and the fact that
 * GitHub then applies their visibility for us and we do not have to reimplement it.
 *
 * What a user token can see is the intersection of what they can reach and where this app is
 * installed. A private repository in an org without proke is invisible, silently, and the client
 * says so rather than pretending the list is everything.

/**
 * `archived:false` because a pull request in an archived repository cannot be merged or reviewed,
 * and `is:pr` because a GitHub App user token is refused a search that could return both issues
 * and pull requests.
 *
 * Only the viewer's own half asks for review threads. On somebody else's pull request the state
 * of their threads is not what decides where the row goes, and thirty nodes each would be the
 * most expensive thing in the query for no answer. The review decision is in the shared fragment
 * instead - it is one scalar, and both halves have a use for it.
 *
 * The "already approved" filter is applied after this rather than as a `-review:approved` in the
 * search, unlike the draft rule below. The reasons are not symmetric: `draft:false` is a
 * qualifier this query has always used and is known to work, where a search GitHub rejects for
 * a malformed qualifier loses the entire half - and a filter that is on by default would lose it
 * for everybody. Thirty rows of budget occasionally spent on pull requests that are then dropped
 * is the cheaper mistake.
 *
 * `sort:updated-desc` on both halves, matching the order the sections are drawn in. It changes
 * nothing about what the reader sees while both lists fit under the page limits - the classifier
 * sorts what it is given regardless - and everything about *which* fifty come back once one does
 * not. Truncating by best-match and then displaying by recency would drop rows off the bottom of
 * the query that belong at the top of the page.
 *
 * `draft:false` on that half too, and only that half. Your own drafts are worth a pile - they
 * are the work you have started and not sent - but somebody else's draft is not waiting on you,
 * whatever GitHub says about the review request sitting on it. Excluded in the search rather
 * than after it so the page limit is spent on rows that will be shown.
