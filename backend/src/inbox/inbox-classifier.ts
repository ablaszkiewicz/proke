/**
 * Where every pull request goes, and in what order within a pile.
 *
 * Pure, and kept apart from both the fetch and the store, because these are the rules people
 * will argue about - "is an approved pull request with one stray open thread approved?" - and an
 * argument is easier to have against a function than against a GraphQL string.
 *
 * Two entry points, and the difference between them is the whole shape of the feature.
 * `classify` runs once with GitHub's answer in hand and produces what gets stored. Its half of
 * the rules reads facts about the pull request that the stored row does not keep - the review
 * decision, the timestamp - so it cannot be run again later.
 *
 * `groupWaitingOnYou` runs every time a stored snapshot is served. Its half reads facts about
 * the author, all of which the stored row does keep, so it can be run again as often as somebody
 * moves a switch - which is exactly why the settings it answers to cost neither a trip to GitHub
 * nor a place in the cache key. See inbox-filters.interface.ts.

 * is one where somebody is waiting on an answer, and "Approved" would tell the reader there is
 * nothing left to do. Everything else has simply not been looked at yet.
 *
 * The drafts split in two on nothing but recency. A draft you pushed to this morning is what you
 * are working on, and it is the one thing in this pile with any claim on your attention today;
 * the eleven you opened in March are a pile, and the point of a pile is that it stays shut. Same
 * rule, two headings, so the client can open one of them by default without opening the other.
 *
 * How far back "this morning" reaches is the reader's, and so is whether the split happens at
 * all: `recentDrafts: 'off'` returns null for the window, every draft goes to the one pile, and
 * the recent heading is left empty - which is how a section stops being drawn. Nothing about
 * that is a special case here; a window of nothing keeps nothing.
