 * A full replacement, not a patch: unmuting is spelled by sending the set without that type in
 * it, so a merge would make it unspellable.
 *
 * Bounded by the number of types there are, which is the only bound that means anything here -
 * a longer list is either a duplicate or a value the normalizer is about to drop, and neither is
 * worth storing. Values themselves are checked against the enum, so a retired type is a 400
 * rather than a silent no-op, which is the more useful answer to a client that has gone stale.
